The CPU divider node serves as the sole clock for the CPU complex. It supports
power-of-2 clock division, with a divider of "1" as the default highest-speed
setting.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "brcm,brcmstb-cpu-clk-div"
- reg: address and width of the divider configuration register
- #clock-cells: shall be set to 0
- clocks: phandle of clock provider which provides the source clock
          (this would typically be a "fixed-clock" type PLL)
- div-table: list of (raw_value,divider) ordered pairs that correspond to the
             allowed clock divider settings
- div-shift-width: least-significant bit position and width of divider value

Optional properties:
- clocks: additional clocks can be specified if needed
- clock-names: clocks can be named, so they can be looked up

Example:
	sw_scb: sw_scb {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <432000000>;
	};

	fixed0: fixed0 {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <54000000>;
	};

	cpu_pdiv: cpu_pdiv@f04e0008 {
		compatible = "divider-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xf04e0008 0x4>;
		bit-shift = <10>;
		bit-mask = <0xf>;
		index-starts-at-one;
		clocks = <&fixed0>;
		clock-names = "fixed0";
	};

	cpu_ndiv_int: cpu_ndiv_int {
		compatible = "fixed-factor-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-div = <1>;
		clock-mult = <167>;
		clocks = <&cpu_pdiv>;
		clock-names = "cpu_pdiv";
	};

	cpu_mdiv_ch0: cpu_mdiv_ch0@f04e0000 {
		compatible = "divider-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xf04e0000 0x4>;
		bit-shift = <1>;
		bit-mask = <0xff>;
		index-starts-at-one;
		clocks = <&cpu_ndiv_int>;
		clock-names = "cpu_ndiv_int";
	};

	cpupll: cpupll@0 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <1503000000>;
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
	};

	cpuclkdiv: cpu-clk-div@0 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-names = "cpupll",
			"cpu_mdiv_ch0",
			"cpu_ndiv_int",
			"sw_scb";
		clocks = <&cpupll,
			&cpu_mdiv_ch0,
			&cpu_ndiv_int,
			&sw_scb>;
		compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-cpu-clk-div";
		reg = <0xf03e257c 0x4>;
		div-table = <0x00 1>;
		div-shift-width = <0 5>;
	};
